# multi_TCAD_CSV_to_TBL_conversion
i am kanak kujur
the code is used to convert large number of multiple TCAD simulation output in csv format to a required lookup table based csv
my project work reqired to generate look up table of  multiple tcad simulation reading for hspice simulation which takes loots of time hence this code is used to extract the IdVg, Cgd and Cgs from TCAD simulation file output which are saved in csv format in a iterativew manner and at last saving in a single file accorting to distribution.
